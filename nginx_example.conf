# Nginx Configuration for Weeecycle API

It appears you are hosting the site behind a web server (like Nginx) but haven't configured it to talk to the Node.js backend.
You need to add this block to your Nginx site configuration (usually in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` or similar), inside the `server { ... }` block.

```nginx
    # Proxy API requests to the Node.js backend on port 3000
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
```

After adding this, restart Nginx:
`sudo systemctl restart nginx`
